                I devote my time to training young women, ages 18 to 35, digital
                literacy. I have taught more than 100 women digital skills,
                including how to use Canva for graphic design, WordPress and Wix
                for web building, and Figma for website design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I get great joy from assisting women in realizing their full
                potential in the digital realm. Seeing their "aha!" moments and
                the increased freedom these abilities provide is incredibly
                motivating.

                I run a virtual summer school that teaches kids coding. The
                objective is to help these children (10‚Äì18 years) develop their
                problem-solving and critical-thinking skills through web
                programming.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe these skills are essential for success in the digital
                age and that the earlier children develop them, the better. We
                also believe that these skills should be taught in a fun and
                engaging way.
